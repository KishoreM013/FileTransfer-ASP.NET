its a simple file transfter the let you send image, video, pdf from mobile to laptop. 

But the device needs to be connected over same wifi network.

And use the ip address of the pc and see that ip in mobile.

in pc, localhost -> 192.154.x.x then visited this ip in mobile with http and port 5000. not https.

it let you share file from mobile to laptop. but not vice verse.
